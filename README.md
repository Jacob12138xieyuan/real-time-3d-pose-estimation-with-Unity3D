# real-time-3d-pose-estimation-with-Unity3D

### This is version 1.0 of "real time 3d pose estimation with Unity3D". The result is not good at all, I will try to improve it.
### Demo video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m4ywdGlF4U

## Usage: 
### 1. Attach "Assets/Pos_txt_Reader1.cs" file to UnityChan character, and click play game.
### 2. Run "src/webcam3d2.py" python file. Note: you should install some dependences (opencv, tensorflow-gpu)
